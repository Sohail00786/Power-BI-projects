# Accenture-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Programme
## The virtual experience programme is provided by Accenture. I discover how passionate, multidisciplinary experts utilise data visualisation technologies like Tableau and Power BI to take on some of the most difficult business problems and uncover fascinating insights buried in the mountains of produced data. 
### Background
Social Buzz is a media company :
- The brief carefully it states that the client wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.
- As explained in the data model, popularity is quantified by the “Score” given to each reaction type.
- We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score.
- So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.
