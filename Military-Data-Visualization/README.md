### In current military use, combined operations are operations conducted by forces of two or more allied nations acting together for the accomplishment of a common strategy, a strategic and operational and sometimes tactical cooperation. Interaction between units and formations of the land, naval and air forces, or the cooperation between military and civilian authorities in peacekeeping or disaster relief operations is known as joint operations or interoperability capability.

### Aim is to Demonstrate Distribution by Countries on Basis of :
#### 1. Population
 - Population is defined as all nationals present in, or temporarily absent from a country, and aliens permanently settled in a country. This indicator shows the number of people that usually live in an area. Growth rates are the annual changes in population resulting from births, deaths and net migration during the year
#### 2. Military Equipment
 - Military equipment means weapons, arms, military supplies, and equipment that readily may be used for military purposes, including, but not limited to, radar systems or military-grade transport vehicles.
#### 3. Gross Domestic Product
 - Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period. As such, it also measures the income earned from that production, or the total amount spent on final goods and services (less imports)
#### 4. Miltary Budget
 - A military budget (or military expenditure), also known as a defense budget, is the amount of financial resources dedicated by a state to raising and maintaining an armed forces or other methods essential for defense purposes.
#### 5. Soldiers Distribution
 -  A soldier is someone who is willing to sacrifice his own life for the protection of his country and its citizens
#### 6. Per Capita of Total and Active Soldier per 1000
 - money spent by a government to provide its military with soldiers.
#### 7. Country Spending on Miltary Per Capita
 - money spent by a government to provide its military with weapons, equipment, and soldiers
#### 8. Nuclear Weapons
 - nuclear weapon is a device that uses a nuclear reaction to create an explosion. This explosion is much more powerful than that of conventional explosives (like TNT). When a nuclear weapon explodes, it gives off four types of energy: a blast wave, intense light, heat, and radiation.
#### 9. Military Satellite
 - A military satellite is an artificial satellite used for a military purpose. The most common missions are intelligence gathering, navigation and military communications.





### Top Five Countries on Basis of :

#### 1. Population
 
#### 2. Gross Domestic Product
 
#### 3. Nuclear Weapons
 
#### 4. Military Budget
 
#### 5. Military Strength
 
#### 6. Millitary Satellite
 
### Project is distributed in four steps :
#### 1. Web Scraping 
 - Extracted Three Different Tables from Wikipedia using Python, Selenium Webdriver, Jupyter Notebook
#### 2. Data Manipulation
 - Performed Join Operation to Merge all three datatset using Python, Pandas
#### 3. Data Cleaning
 - Formatted the Dataset using excel
#### 4. Data Visualization
 - Visualized the Dataset to meaningful Report using Power BI
