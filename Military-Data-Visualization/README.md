## Military Data Visualization 
### Introduction :
 A military, also known collectively as armed forces, is a heavily armed, highly organized force primarily intended for warfare.The main task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its interests against external armed threats.

### Project Overview :
#### Aim is to Demonstrate Distribution by Countries on Basis of :
1. Population
- Population is defined as all nationals present in, or temporarily absent from a country, and aliens permanently settled in a country. This indicator shows the number of people that usually live in an area. Growth rates are the annual changes in population resulting from births, deaths and net migration during the year
2. Military Equipment
- Military equipment means weapons, arms, military supplies, and equipment that readily may be used for military purposes, including, but not limited to, radar systems or military-grade transport vehicles.
3. Gross Domestic Product
- Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period. As such, it also measures the income earned from that production, or the total amount spent on final goods and services (less imports)
4. Miltary Budget
- A military budget (or military expenditure), also known as a defense budget, is the amount of financial resources dedicated by a state to raising and maintaining an armed forces or other methods essential for defense purposes.
5. Soldiers Distribution
-  A soldier is someone who is willing to sacrifice his own life for the protection of his country and its citizens
6. Per Capita of Total and Active Soldier per 1000
- money spent by a government to provide its military with soldiers.
7. Country Spending on Miltary Per Capita
- money spent by a government to provide its military with weapons, equipment, and soldiers.

### Project is Distributed in Three Stages :
1. Web Scraping 
- Extracted Three Different Tables from Wikipedia using Python, Selenium Webdriver, Jupyter Notebook
2. Data Manipulation
- Performed Join Operation to Merge all three datatset using Python, Pandas
3. Data Cleaning
- Formatted the Dataset using excel
4. Data Visualization
- Visualized the Dataset to meaningful Report using Power BI
