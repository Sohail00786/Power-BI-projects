### Introduction 
 A military, also known collectively as armed forces, is a heavily armed, highly organized force primarily intended for warfare.The main task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its interests against external armed threats.

It is God’s duty to forgive the enemies, but it’s our duty to convene a meeting between the two.
